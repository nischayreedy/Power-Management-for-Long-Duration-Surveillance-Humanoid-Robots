## 🔥 The Challenge: When Robots Get Hangry!

Ever had your phone die at a critical moment? Now imagine that happening to a long-duration surveillance humanoid robot. Not great. Our bots were facing two big villains on their missions: **scorching heat** from their processors and **wobbly power supplies**.

This college-funded project was a quest to defeat these enemies and give our robots the endurance they deserve!

## 🎯 Our Mission: The Power-Up Quest

Our goal was to become the ultimate "battery whisperer" for our humanoid. To do this, we had to:

* **Battle of the Batteries**: Test different power sources to find the champion of discharge profiles, thermal output, and overall efficiency.
* **Invent a "Chill Pill"**: Design a way to stop the robot's brain from overheating during long stakeouts.
* **Create Rock-Solid Power**: Tame the wild voltage fluctuations that could cause a system crash.

## 🛠️ Our Secret Weapon: The Custom Heat Sink

After intense research, we forged our ultimate weapon: a **custom-designed heat sink**! This wasn't just any old piece of metal; it was engineered specifically to fit our system and pull heat away like a pro, keeping the core systems cool and stable.

## 🏆 Epic Wins: The Results Are In!

So, how did our creation perform in battle? The results were legendary!

* **❄️ ICE COLD PERFORMANCE**: We achieved a massive **45% improvement in the thermal efficiency** of the Raspberry Pi brain! 
* **⚡️ STEADY AS A ROCK**: We crushed the instability, **reducing voltage fluctuations by a solid 20%**

The bottom line? Our robot can now stay on duty longer and more reliably, all without breaking a sweat.
